# Prompts and Annotation Guidelines for the
# Speech Accessibility Project

This directory contains

* Guidelines used by annotators in the Speech Accessibility Project, and
* Copies of the lists of prompts given to participants to elicit their speech.

## Annotation Guidelines

There are three types of annotations.

* Transcription of read speech: Read speech is transcribed by modifying the prompt to make it match what the person actually said.  This may include inserting, deleting, or changing words.  There is no extra annotation guideline for this task; if an annotator finds it ambiguous, they refer to the spontaneous speech transcription guidelines.
* Transcription of spontaneous speech is performed according to the [Spontaneous Speech Transcription Guidelines](Spontaneous Speech Transcription Guidelines May2023.pdf)
* Fifteen utterances per participant are annotated using the [SLP Annotation Descriptors](SLP Annotation Descriptors.docx)

## Prompts

There are four prompt sets.  These are assigned based on etiology of the disorder, and in one case, based on participant choice among available alternatives.  Prompt lists have been edited to exclude prompts that occur exclusively in the designated test set, i.e., in list 9 and list 10.

### Parkinson's disease and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis

Participants with PD and ALS read prompts written at approximately a tenth-grade reading level, and focusing on named entities and concepts likely to be familiar to a person over fifty years of age in 2023.  These prompt lists were developed by Heejin Kim and Clarion Mendes in collaboration with consultants from LSVT, Global.  Each participant receives a mixture of prompts from several subcategories:

* [Computer commands in block 1 and block 10](./commands_b1_b10_PD.txt) are read by all participants
* [Computer commands in blocks 2-9](./commands b2-9_PD.xlsx) are each read by 20% or 10% of participants
* [Novel extracts in block 1 and block 10](./novel_b1_b10_PD.xlsx) are read by all participants
* [Novel extracts in blocks 2-9](./novel-b2-9-150_PD.xlsx) are each read by approximately 0.75% of participants
* Each participant responds spontaneously to the same set of [spontaneous speech prompts](./Spontaneous speech prompts_PD.xlsx).

### Down syndrome and cerebral palsy

Participants with DS read prompts written at approximately a fifth-grade reading level, and focusing on named entities and concepts likely to be familiar to a person under fifty years of age in 2023.  These prompt lists were developed by Heejin Kim, Clarion Mendes, Laura Mattie, and Marie Moore-Channell.  Participants with CP may also read these prompts if they so choose.    Each participant receives a mixture of prompts from several subcategories:

* [Computer commands in block 1 and block 10](./commands_b1_b10_DS_35perBlock.xlsx) are read by all participants
* [Computer commands in blocks 2-9](./commands_b2-9_DS _35perBlock.xlsx) are each read by either 20% or 10% of participants
* Each participant responds spontaneously to the same sets of spontaneous speech prompts in [block 1 and block 10](./Spon_Speech_Prompts_b1_b10_DS_8perBlock.xlsx) and in [blocks 2-9](./Spon_Speech_Prompts_b2-9_DS_8perBlock.xlsx).

### Nonverbal cerebral palsy

Some participants with CP have difficulty producing speech that is intelligible even to close friends; consultants with CP have used the term "nonverbal" to describe this symptom.  All participants with CP are therefore offered the option of reading isolated words, drawn from lists created by Dr. Heejin Kim, instead of responding to prompts for spontaneous speech.  These participants read the same computer commands as others with CP, but instead of responding to prompts for spontaneous speech, they read from the following lists:

* [Isolated words for block 1 and block 10](./nonverbal_b1_b10.xlsx) are read by all participants
* [UASpeech words for blocks 2-9](./nonverbal_b2-9_UA.xlsx) are each read by 10% of participants
* [Isolated words chosen from the 5000 most frequent words of English](./nonverbal_b2-9_5k-v2.xlsx) are each read by approximately 0.99% of participants

### Stroke

Participants with Stroke read from prompt lists developed by Heejin Kim and Clarion Mendes in collaboration with Lingraphica.

* [Computer commands in block 1 and block 10](./commands_b1_b10_Stroke_35perBlock.xlsx) are read by all participants.
* [Computer commands in blocks 2-9](./commands_b2-9_Stroke _35perBlock.xlsx) are each read by 20% or 10% of participants.
* Each participant responds spontaneously to the same sets of spontaneous speech prompts in [block 1 and block 10](./Spon_Speech_Prompts_b1_b10_Stroke_8perBlock.xlsx) and in [blocks 2-9](./Spon_Speech_Prompts_b2-9_Stroke_8perBlock.xlsx).
